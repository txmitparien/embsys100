Week2 Assignment

1.)	a.) The value of the “counter” from the “Locals” window is **0x20000000 (536870912)**.

	  b.) The value of the “counter” in the “Register” window is 0x20000000 (536870912).
    
	  c.) There isn’t any set flags for this operation. The reason why there isn’t any set flags is because 
    there isn’t any Negative Condition (Z), Carry Condition (C), Overflow Condition (V), 
    Overflow or Saturation Condition (Q), or Greater than or Equal Condition (GE) in this operation.
    
2.)	a.) The value of “counter” in the *“Locals”* window changed to **0x00000000 (0)**.

	  b.) The APSR set Zero Condition (Z) flag and Carry Condition (C) flag.  
    
3.)	a.) The value of “counter” in the **“Locals”** window changed to **0x20000000 (536870912)**.

	  b.) There isn’t any set flags for this operation.
    
4.)	a.) The value of “counter” in the **“Locals”** window changed to **0x00000000 (0)**.

	  b.) The APSR set Zero Condition (Z) flag and Carry Condition (C) flag. The reason why ASPR set these flags 
    are because the value has become zero and there is a bit carry over beyond these 2 nipples.
    
5.)	a.) The scope of the variable “counter” is now a **global variable**.

	  b.) No, it’s not visible in the “Locals” view anymore.
    
	  c.) In this class, the variable “counter” can be viewed in **both Auto or Static window**. 
    The difference is that the Statics window will only show the changes to the “counter” 
    variable only inside “main” module but Auto window will show you the changes to the “counter” beyond “main”.
    
	  d.) The address of the “counter” variable in memory is 0x20000000.
    
6.)	a.) The value of the “counter” is **4** at the end of the program.

	  b.) The counter value has changed because the “counter” variable is a global variable which has 
    an address of 0x20000000. We then created a pointer variable “p_int” which would point to address of 
    the “counter” variable and incremented the dereference value of that address 3 times. Lastly, we incremented 
    the “counter” one more time.
    
7.)	a.) The “counter” variable is stored at **0x20000000**.

	  b.) The “counter” variable is stored in RAM.  
    
	  c.)  The value of the “counter” is 4 at the end of the program.
